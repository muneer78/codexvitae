# Codex Vitae

## How to Use This Codex

If you are Muneer:

- Develop a habit of using the Codex as a repository for beliefs that develop throughout the year.
- Consider doing a monthly review of whether my life is in alignment with values and beliefs. If not, should my behavior change or have my understanding and values changed?
- Do a yearly review in January of the entire document, editing places where beliefs have changed. Expect beliefs and tactics to change — don’t hold on to them too rigidly.

If you are not Muneer:

- Read this with the understanding that you are different than Muneer— the way he lives his life is not the way you should live yours.
- Consider creating your own Codex Vitae. Feel free to copy anything here that is helpful.

## In General

### Meta-beliefs

Beliefs about beliefs.

* Perceptions color beliefs in a way that prevents humans from having identical beliefs.
* No belief is absolutely correct.
* Beware of anyone who is totally convinced that their beliefs are correct.

### Principles
Fundamentals that guide my life.

#### Personal
* Never stop learning new things.

#### Society
* There should be no group or insitution that is absolutely insulated from criticism.
* There needs to be an adequate safety net to help people who are experiencing tough times.
  * This includes not cutting off benefits to people when they begin working again, but do not yet have the resources to have minimal financial security.
  * There should be an incentive for people to work.
    * This means that we need to do things like give retraining to people in dying industries.
    * It does not mean increasingly draconian cuts to public assistance.
* We need to encourage people to acquire skills that will keep them working.
  * Sinecures should be eliminated wherever they are found.
  * 
* We need to reduce the amount of no-value adding bureaucracy.
  * Regulations need to be put up for periodic review in front of a citizen committee that contains as much diversity of viewpoints as possible.
  * The law needs to be simplified to a level where it can be understood by an educated layperson 
* There needs to be a minimum expected level of competence for adults.

#### Politics
* Elections should be publicly funded in full.
  * There should also be a cap on how much can be spent on elections. The amounts can increase as the level of the election changes. For example, a person running for a county office should not be spending at the level of someone running for state office.
