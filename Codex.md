#### Codex Vitae

### How to Use This Codex

If you are Muneer:

- Develop a habit of using the Codex as a repository for beliefs that develop throughout the year.
- Consider doing a monthly review of whether my life is in alignment with values and beliefs. If not, should my behavior change or have my understanding and values changed?
- Do a yearly review in January of the entire document, editing places where beliefs have changed. Expect beliefs and tactics to change — don’t hold on to them too rigidly.

If you are not (Muneer):

- Read this with the understanding that you are different than Muneer— the way he lives his life is not the way you should live yours.
- Consider creating your own Codex Vitae. Feel free to copy anything here that is helpful.
