# Meta-beliefs

## Beliefs about beliefs.
1. Perceptions color beliefs in a way that prevents humans from having identical beliefs.
2. No belief is absolutely correct.
3. Beware of anyone who is totally convinced that their beliefs are correct.

# Principles
Fundamentals that guide my life.

## Personal
1. Never stop learning new things.

## Society
1. There should be no group or insitution that is absolutely insulated from criticism.
2. There needs to be an adequate safety net to help people who are experiencing tough times.
    1. This includes not cutting off benefits to people when they begin working again, but do not yet have the resources to have minimal financial security.
3. There should be an incentive for people to work.
    1. This means that we need to do things like give retraining to people in dying industries.
    2. It does not mean increasingly draconian cuts to public assistance.
4. We need to encourage people to acquire skills that will keep them working.
    1. Sinecures should be eliminated wherever they are found.
5. We need to reduce the amount of no-value adding bureaucracy.
    1. Regulations need to be put up for periodic review in front of a citizen committee that contains as much diversity of viewpoints as possible.
    2. The law needs to be simplified to a level where it can be understood by an educated layperson
6. There needs to be a minimum expected level of competence for adults.

## Politics
1. Elections should be publicly funded in full.
    1. There should also be a cap on how much can be spent on elections. The amounts can increase as the level of the election changes. 
    2. For example, a person running for a county office should not be spending at the level of someone running for state office.
